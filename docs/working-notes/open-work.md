# Open work

**Status:** Index — what to do next. Read first.

## Now

**Chunk 4 — ingest.** Plex dump importer first, since that data is already on
disk, then the Tautulli and Sonarr webhook receivers per
[ingest-architecture.md](ingest-architecture.md). Webhook routes must check
`WEBHOOK_SECRET`; the endpoint is publicly reachable by design.

## Next

1. **UI design brainstorm** — interactive, with mockups and previews. Owner
   asked for this before any frontend work starts, so the SPA is deliberately
   deferred until it happens. Read model and screen inventory are open
   questions until then.
2. **`apps/web`** — Vite + React SPA, shaped by whatever the brainstorm
   settles on.

## Blocked

- **Tautulli is not installed.** Bytesized was having problems as of 2026-09-16.
  Live webhook ingest cannot be verified until it is up. Everything through
  chunk 4's importer is unaffected, since the Plex dump is already captured.
- **Tautulli webhook payload shape is unverified.** Which external-id parameters
  actually populate per media type needs one empirical check against a throwaway
  endpoint before any parsing code is trusted.

## Decisions still open

- **Eager vs lazy `episode` row creation.** Eager makes gap detection trivial
  at the cost of a TMDB call per season.
- **Whether legacy-agent libraries exist here.** If they do, the season and
  episode in a legacy GUID are the only carrier of that information and
  `parseGuid` currently discards it. See
  [ingest-architecture.md](ingest-architecture.md).

## Done

- **2026-09-16** — `apps/api` landed: Drizzle schema for the five tables,
  Postgres 18 in Compose, migrations, config validation, health and readiness
  endpoints, and `ops/backup.sh`. Verified against a live database: the
  migration applies, `watch_state` derives correctly, re-ingesting the same
  source event is a no-op, and a duplicate canonical key is rejected.
  `watch_state` is a view rather than a table, so it cannot drift from the
  events it summarises and there is no rebuild step to forget.

- **2026-09-16** — `packages/shared` landed: canonical identity model
  (`titleKey`, `episodeKey`, `sameTitle`, `mergeIds`) and the Plex GUID
  normalizer, 19 tests. Shows key on tvdb and movies on tmdb to match what
  Sonarr and Radarr use natively, so their webhook payloads need no translation.
  `titleKey` returns null rather than inventing a key for a title with no
  external id: such a title cannot survive a redownload and must go to manual
  resolution. The normalizer moved out of `tools/`, which now imports it, so
  there is one implementation rather than two drifting copies.
- **2026-09-16** — Plex history archived before any further decay: 86 plays, 11
  titles, 2025-10-24 → 2026-09-13. Resolution pass returned 11/11 titles with
  full TMDB/TVDB/IMDb coverage. Findings in [plex-api-findings.md](plex-api-findings.md).
- **2026-09-16** — Named the project, chose separate API + React SPA over a
  single Next.js app, on the grounds that the background work (webhook receiver,
  nightly reconcile, enrichment queue, Plex write-back) is real backend work.
