# Open work

**Status:** Index — what to do next. Read first.

## Now

**Owner-only authentication.** GitHub OAuth, porting the hand-rolled flow
already running in `vyoh.gg` rather than inventing a second one. Settled
2026-09-17; design in [authentication.md](authentication.md). It comes before
the write routes because those write the record this project exists to keep,
and nothing authenticates a request today.

## Next

1. **Manual write path** — a core write path rather than a convenience: the
   record is what the project keeps, and Plex reaches back only to 2025-10-24.
   Finding a title is done; what remains is
   1. `POST /titles` — create a title from a chosen candidate, resolving its
      tvdb id and eagerly creating a season's episode rows from TMDB in the
      same call.
   2. `POST /watch-events` — bulk season marking over the derived
      `manual:{titleKey}:S2E5` id in [data-model.md](data-model.md).
2. **`apps/web`** — Vite + React SPA, shaped by the settled design: a poster
   wall filtered by state, a title page built around the episode grid, and
   adding a title by hand as a screen of its own.
3. **Owner-only ingest** — an allowlist of Plex account ids in config, enforced
   at the ingest boundary, dropping a play by anyone else rather than storing
   it. Reasoning in [ingest-architecture.md](ingest-architecture.md). Must land
   before webhooks do: the backfill is owner-only by property of the Plex
   endpoint, and Tautulli fires for every user on the server.
4. **Webhook receivers** — Tautulli and Sonarr, per
   [ingest-architecture.md](ingest-architecture.md). Deferred deliberately:
   Tautulli is not installed, and receiving live webhooks in development needs
   either a tunnel or a netcup deploy. Routes must check `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Blocked

- **Tautulli is not installed.** Bytesized was having problems as of 2026-09-16.
  Live webhook ingest cannot be verified until it is up. Everything through
  chunk 4's importer is unaffected, since the Plex dump is already captured.
- **Tautulli webhook payload shape is unverified.** Which external-id parameters
  actually populate per media type needs one empirical check against a throwaway
  endpoint before any parsing code is trusted.
- **`DATABASE_URL` in `.env` names port 5432, but Compose publishes 55432.**
  Migrations only run with the port overridden. Exactly the mismatch
  `.env.example` warns about.

## Decisions still open

- **Whether legacy-agent libraries exist here.** If they do, the season and
  episode in a legacy GUID are the only carrier of that information and
  `parseGuid` currently discards it. See
  [ingest-architecture.md](ingest-architecture.md).

## Done

- **2026-09-17** — Titles can be marked as not the owner's: `intent.excluded_at`
  is a nullable timestamp, and a non-null value hides the title from the default
  view. A shared Sonarr and Radarr put things on disk nobody here will watch,
  and `want = false` could not say so — it is every row's default and already
  means "no opinion". Verified against the live database: column present and
  nullable, a round trip carrying a reason in `note`, and `excluded_at is null`
  partitioning cleanly. Reasoning in [data-model.md](data-model.md).

- **2026-09-17** — Title search landed: `GET /search?q=` over TMDB's
  `/search/multi`, returning kind, tmdb id, name, year, poster path and
  overview. Verified against live TMDB — 20 results for "the witcher", both
  kinds, posters and years intact. The key is a v3 one and authenticates by
  query parameter; the same key as a bearer token returns 401, so nothing about
  a request may reach a log line, and the client's error type carries the
  upstream status and nothing else. `/search/multi` also returns people, which
  are dropped. The route answers 503 rather than going unregistered when no key
  is configured, so a missing capability does not look like a wrong path.

  Routes now assemble through `buildApp()` in `apps/api/src/app.ts` and
  `server.ts` is the entry that owns the process. That is what makes a route
  testable: the first HTTP tests in the repo drive `app.inject()` against a
  stub, with no port, network or database.

- **2026-09-17** — UI direction settled. A poster wall filtered by state is the
  home, a title page built around an episode grid is where the work happens, and
  adding a title by hand is a screen of its own rather than a setting. Espresso
  ground so artwork is the only saturated thing on screen; jade for the
  affirmative, kept clear of the gold that means "in progress"; Archivo names
  things and Martian Mono sets every figure. Long names wrap to two lines and
  drop a subtitle past a colon, which is a layout answer to truncation rather
  than a typographic one.

  Two findings drove it. The owner's own record contains the argument: ONE PIECE
  S2E5 sits between a rewatch of E4 and a play of E6, so the UI has to let you
  say whether a hole was skipped or never downloaded. And TMDB returns
  `poster_path` inline with a search result while its image CDN needs no key
  — verified 2026-09-17, an unauthenticated poster returns 200 and a bad path
  returns 404 rather than 403 — so added titles carry artwork immediately and a
  generated cover is only the fallback.

- **2026-09-17** — Date precision landed, so the record can hold something
  watched years ago. `watched_at` is nullable and `watched_precision` carries
  `exact | day | month | year | unknown`, tied together by a check constraint in
  both directions; `watch_state` reports a precision per boundary rather than
  one for the row, since a group can hold a remembered year and an exact play at
  once. Verified against the live database: all 86 existing plays backfilled to
  `exact` with timestamps intact, the column default dropped so a later insert
  must state its own precision, a dateless row accepted and surfacing with null
  boundaries and a real `play_count`, both invalid combinations rejected, and a
  2019 entry beside an exact play reporting `year` on first and `exact` on last.
  Reasoning in [data-model.md](data-model.md).

- **2026-09-16** — Plex dump importer landed. All 86 plays imported from the
  archive with nothing dropped or degraded: 11 titles, 79 episodes, 6 rewatches
  detected. Re-running inserts 0 new events, so the idempotency the reconcile
  design depends on is proven rather than assumed. Plex history carries no
  progress fields at all — a row exists only because Plex already decided the
  item was watched — so these events are stored `completed` with a null
  percentage, and `completed` stays computed at ingest so Tautulli's real
  percentages can use the same threshold later.

- **2026-09-16** — `apps/api` landed: Drizzle schema for the five tables,
  Postgres 18 in Compose, migrations, config validation, health and readiness
  endpoints, and `ops/backup.sh`. Verified against a live database: the
  migration applies, `watch_state` derives correctly, re-ingesting the same
  source event is a no-op, and a duplicate canonical key is rejected.
  `watch_state` is a view rather than a table, so it cannot drift from the
  events it summarises and there is no rebuild step to forget.

- **2026-09-16** — `packages/shared` landed: canonical identity model
  (`titleKey`, `episodeKey`, `sameTitle`, `mergeIds`) and the Plex GUID
  normalizer, 19 tests. Shows key on tvdb and movies on tmdb to match what
  Sonarr and Radarr use natively, so their webhook payloads need no translation.
  `titleKey` returns null rather than inventing a key for a title with no
  external id: such a title cannot survive a redownload and must go to manual
  resolution. The normalizer moved out of `tools/`, which now imports it, so
  there is one implementation rather than two drifting copies.
- **2026-09-16** — Plex history archived before any further decay: 86 plays, 11
  titles, 2025-10-24 → 2026-09-13. Resolution pass returned 11/11 titles with
  full TMDB/TVDB/IMDb coverage. Findings in [plex-api-findings.md](plex-api-findings.md).
- **2026-09-16** — Named the project, chose separate API + React SPA over a
  single Next.js app, on the grounds that the background work (webhook receiver,
  nightly reconcile, enrichment queue, Plex write-back) is real backend work.
